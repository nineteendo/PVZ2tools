RTONS Parser instructions:

1. If you don't have Python 3.x, get it here:

   https://www.python.org/downloads/

   I tested this with Python 3; if you have Python 2.x this may not work properly

2. Add Python to your path: http://superuser.com/a/143121/43514

   (in this case it will be C:\Python34 instead of C:\Python27)

3. Put rton files in /rtons where you extracted this

4a. Run rtons.py if you want to parse json files to /rtons
4b. Run rtons_to_jsons.py if you want to parse json files to /jsons

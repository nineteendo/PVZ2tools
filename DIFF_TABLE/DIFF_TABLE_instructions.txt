DIFF TABLE instructions:

1. If you don't have Python 3.x, get it here:

   https://www.python.org/downloads/

   I tested this with Python 3; if you have Python 2.x this may not work properly

2. Add Python to your path: http://superuser.com/a/143121/43514

   (in this case it will be C:\Python34 instead of C:\Python27)

3a. Edit DIFF_TABLE_REMOVED_X_S.py for checklist of all versions with a value till first removal
3b. Edit DIFF_TABLE_ABSENT_X_S.py for checklist of all versions with a value
3c. Edit DIFF_TABLE_REMOVED_VERSIONS.py for first and last version with a value
3d. Edit DIFF_TABLE_ABSENT_VERSIONS.py for first and last versions with a value

4.  Change ZOMBIETYPES.json into the repeating path of the file you want to check, save and run that script.
